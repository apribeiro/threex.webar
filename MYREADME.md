# How To Run The Demo ?
- put a browser on https://apribeiro.github.io/threex.webar/examples/basic.html
- it will read your webcam using [getUserMedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/getUserMedia)
  - if it asks for permission, allow it :)
- it will recognize the marker you put in front of the mcamera
  - get the marker from [here](http://jeromeetienne.github.io/threex.webar/marker/image-marker-265.html)
  - you can print it and point the camera toward the paper
  - or you can load the marker web page and put the phone in front of the camera
